## Project Abstract
A properly functioning search engine is an important part of creating websites. Correct recommendations can increase your traffic and profits. The results are based on the quantity and quality of the collected data and the selected recommendation model. In this work, I created a search engine for an aggregator of educational resources. The problem was solved by several approaches that were compared with each other.


## Problem
In given case, we are dealing with a limited set of names and descriptions of websites with an emphasis on training and education. The main problem of this task is the lack of user requests data and website transitions, so we can use only titles and descriptions. Also, the data is not labelled, so we can’t measure the accuracy of suggestions. However, by trial and error when using the current TF-IDF model, cases of unsatisfactory recommendations were identified. They can be used as a approbation of the proposed models. Moreover, the adequacy of the recommendations can be checked ‘manually’.
